    About posX
     posX is Most Advanced Teleport Generator Script ever you can see. Designed for autofarm developers.
 
    Why its obfuscated? Its only doing setclipboard? Are u logging our grandmoms credit card info?
     Current source code is too messy and im learning new things such as lerp. When the script fully done, source beautified, ill share the source. And no, i dont log.
 
    How its started?
     I was searching cordinate grabber(to make some things easier) for autofarm and all scripts were trash, so i made this teleport generator.
